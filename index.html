        <h2>"<u>Great expectations</u>"</h2>
        <h3><u>de Charles Dickens</u></h3>
            <br>
        <p>Great Expectations is the thirteenth novel by Charles Dickens and his <b><i>penultimate completed</i></b> novel: <br> a bildungsroman that depicts 
            the <b><i>personal</i></b> growth and <b><i>personal</i></b> development of an orphan nicknamed Pip. <br> It is Dickens's <b><i>second</i></b> novel, after 
            David Copperfield, to be <b><i>fully narrated</i></b> in the first person. The novel was first <br> published as a serial in Dickens's weekly periodical 
            All the Year Round, from 1 December 1860 to August 1861.<br> In October 1861, Chapman and Hall published the novel in three volumes. The novel is set 
            in Kent and London <br> in the early to mid-19th century and contains some of Dickens's most <b><i>memorable</i></b> scenes, including the opening <br> in a 
            graveyard, where the young Pip is accosted by the escaped convict, Abel Magwitch. Great Expectations is <br> full of extreme imageryâ€”poverty, prison ships 
            and chains, and fights to the death and has a <b><I>colourful</I></b> cast of <br> characters who have entered popular culture. These include the 
            <b><i>eccentric</i></b> Miss Havisham, the <b><i>beautiful but cold</i></b> <br> Estella, and Joe, the <b><i>unsophisticated</i></b> and <b><i>kind</i></b> 
            blacksmith. Dickens's themes include wealth and poverty, love and <br> rejection, and the eventual triumph of good over evil. Great Expectations, which is 
            <b><i>popular</i></b> both with readers and <br> literary critics, has been translated into many languages and adapted <b><i>numerous</i></b> times into
            <b><i>various</i></b> media.</p>
